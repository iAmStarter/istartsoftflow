# iStartSoftFlow — portable agent methodology (single source of truth)

> **Adapted for Saku POS (from the open "anpunkit" workflow by MetheeS).**
> Namespaced under `.claude/istartsoft-flow/` to coexist with the repo's own
> `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` (Saku project docs) — it does NOT replace them.
> Cursor support and the Azure infra phase were removed: this repo is Claude-only
> and infra is **managed (Vercel + Supabase)**, so **Phase 0 (infra) is N/A** —
> phases begin at the first vertical slice. Planning source of truth stays in
> **iSSM/BMAD** (PRD/architecture/stories); iStartSoftFlow is the execution loop on top.

Caveman ULTRA mode always on. Apply the `karpathy-guidelines` skill (engineering
discipline) on every coding and debugging task.

## The loop

`design-research -> grill (×2) -> plan -> implement -> test -> deploy`, one
VERTICAL SLICE per phase. Implement AND test a phase before the next. The last
phase always includes deployment.

A phase runs in one of two orders, chosen at RESEARCH time by the TDD
APPLICABILITY check (see Procedures → `phase`):

- **TDD phase** (`TDD_PHASE=true`):
  `RESEARCH -> SCAFFOLD -> RED -> GREEN -> TEST(e2e) -> FIX -> CLOSE`
- **Non-TDD phase** (pure infra / config / doc — `TDD_PHASE=false`):
  `RESEARCH -> IMPLEMENT -> TEST -> FIX -> CLOSE`

`TDD_PHASE` = "the phase adds or changes a public callable surface (an endpoint,
exported function/class, CLI command, or message contract) that is assertable
from the acceptance spec." Size is NOT the criterion. On ambiguity, default
`TDD_PHASE=true` AND state the classification + reason so a human can override to
non-TDD before SCAFFOLD fires.

-----

## Roles (fresh-context workers)

Each role is a fresh-context worker. Where the host tool supports named subagents
(Claude Code natively; Cursor reads the same `.claude/agents/` files via its
Claude-compatibility path), each maps to a definition file. Where it does not, the role
degrades to a bounded sub-task that dumps its noise to a file and returns only a
terse summary + path. Workers cannot address the user — only the orchestrator
can. Escalation is at most two hops.

- **researcher** — two modes. DESIGN: domain/constraint research before planning
  (service limits, API contracts, architectural constraints, cost surprises).
  IMPL: per-phase codebase + service investigation. Checks the shared KB snapshot
  first (step 0). Writes findings to `docs/research/`; returns terse summary + path.
- **planner** — research → vertical-slice `docs/PLAN.md`. Phase 0 (infra) always
  first; the last phase always contains the deploy task.
- **implementer** — builds ONE phase. Two MODES for TDD phases (SCAFFOLD: stubs
  only; FILL: logic to green) plus a legacy full-build mode for non-TDD phases.
  Writes code, never tests. Maintains `docs/ENDPOINTS.md` each phase.
- **test-author** — writes tests BLIND (never reads implementation logic). On TDD
  phases it is dispatched BEFORE logic exists (RED-first), so blindness is
  structural, not honor-system. Writes a MOCK suite + a REAL API suite.
- **e2e-runner** — writes/runs functional browser E2E (Playwright) BLIND. Reads
- **debugger** — debugs in an ISOLATED context. Writes a trace to
  `docs/research/debug-<slug>.md`; returns a summary.
- **synthesizer** — compresses `docs/STATE.md` / `docs/ISSUES.md`, prunes
  snapshots. On the final phase, also updates `README.md` + `docs/OVERVIEW.md`.

The orchestrator ROUTES. It does not implement or debug.

-----

## Procedures (the slash-command set)

Named procedures, each with a canonical body in `commands.src/<name>.md` and a
generated copy per tool (`.claude/commands/`, `.cursor/commands/`).

- **overview** — bootstrap a project: design-research → grill r1 → design-research
  → re-grill r2 → `OVERVIEW.md` → planner → `PLAN.md` (Phase 0 always first).
- **phase [n]** — run one phase end-to-end with the circuit breaker. Chooses the
  TDD or non-TDD order at RESEARCH. CLOSE runs the regression guard + ENDPOINTS
  coverage gate.
- **quick [change]** — small, obvious, non-phase change; no agent chain. Stays
  non-TDD. Runs the mock regression corpus after the change.
- **unstuck** — deep re-research after a circuit breaker (human-triggered).
- **synthesize** — compress STATE.md, dedup ISSUES.md, prune snapshots. Run
  before a context reset.
- **replan** — revise `PLAN.md` (add/cut/split/merge/reorder pending phases) and
  reconcile the regression corpus in step.
- **log-issue** — append an error to `ISSUES.md` with root cause + failed attempts.
- **log-decision** — record an architectural change in `docs/DESIGN_LOG.md`.
- **store-wisdom** — promote resolved issues + research to the shared KB.

## Rituals (model-run fallback for hooks)

Where the host tool can run lifecycle hooks (Claude Code, Cursor), these rituals
are AUTOMATED by hook scripts and must NOT be run by hand. Where the tool cannot
inject context, the model performs them itself.

### SESSION-OPEN (start / clear / compact-resume)

At the start of every session, before any other work, surface:
1. git state (branch, uncommitted count, last 3 commits).
2. `docs/STATE.md` — the current position. READ THIS FIRST.
3. open items in `docs/ISSUES.md`.
4. `docs/research/INDEX.md` (research map) + infra status + auth nudge.
5. shared KB: pull latest + load `docs/.kb-snapshot.md` if `.claude/kb-config.json`
   exists.
6. a one-line reminder of the hard rules below.

### COMPRESS (before a context compaction)

Snapshot the live position to `docs/.snapshots/` so a post-compact session can
recover: current phase, next action, open blocker.

-----

## Hard rules (1–11)

1. Before debugging ANY error: grep `docs/ISSUES.md` AND `docs/research/INDEX.md`.
   The SESSION-OPEN ritual surfaces ISSUES.md — there is no excuse to miss it.
2. Debug attempt cap = 3: WARN the user at attempt 2; the FIRST hard-stop at 3
   STOPS and asks the user. No 4th in-place attempt.
3. Every resolved error -> logged to `docs/ISSUES.md` with root cause + failed
   attempts.
4. End of phase -> synthesize -> context reset -> next phase.
5. **PHASE GATE** = the current-phase REAL API suite passes AND (frontend phase)
   the E2E suite passes AND the accumulated mock regression corpus stays green AND
   every `docs/ENDPOINTS.md` entry has at least one test in `tests/regression/`.
   The final phase additionally runs the full REAL regression corpus. A green
   mock suite alone can never close a phase.
6. Tests are written by `test-author`, which never sees the implementation logic
   (unbiased). On TDD phases the suite is written before the logic (RED-first).
   `STACK NOT READY` / `FLAKE` do not spend the debug budget. Only `LOGIC FAIL`
   reaches the debugger.
8. E2E auth = ROPC with a dedicated MFA-excluded test account. NEVER script the
   Microsoft login UI.
9. Architectural change (new/removed agent, hook, command, or a changed workflow
   rule)? -> run `log-decision` before closing.
    work. Never debug an auth error without checking this first.
11. **No-rationalization (scoped).** Do not downgrade a TDD phase to non-TDD to
    dodge the RED gate, and do not route phase-worthy work through `quick` to
    dodge it. (Scoped deliberately to these two seams; this is not a broad
    "never make excuses" rule.)

-----

## Shared KB (optional)

If `.claude/kb-config.json` exists, the SESSION-OPEN ritual pulls the KB and loads
a snapshot to `docs/.kb-snapshot.md`. The researcher checks the snapshot (step 0)
before any web search. Run `store-wisdom` to promote resolved issues + research to
the KB. The kit works normally without a KB.

-----

## File contract

- `docs/STATE.md` — current position. Small. Rewritten, not appended.
- `docs/ISSUES.md` — error log. Deduped by synthesizer.
- `docs/PLAN.md` — the phase plan. Phase 0 (infra) always first; last phase has
  the deploy task.
- `docs/HISTORY.md` — one line per finished phase.
- `docs/DESIGN_LOG.md` — kit architectural rationale (§5.x decision log).
- `docs/OVERVIEW.md` — project scope. Written after the double-grill in `overview`.
  E2E target.
- `docs/ENDPOINTS.md` — API/service endpoint catalogue. Maintained by implementer
  each phase. Drives the CLOSE coverage gate.
- `docs/research/` — full research + debug files. `INDEX.md` is the searchable map.
  `design-<slug>.md` (design research), `<slug>.md` (impl research),
  `debug-<slug>.md` (debugger traces).
- `docs/.snapshots/` — pre-compact recovery markers (auto-pruned, gitignored).
  holds no secrets.
- `e2e/`, `scripts/e2e-stack.sh`, `docker-compose.test.yml`, `playwright.config.ts`
  — the E2E stack.
- `tests/phase-<n>/` — phase-local test suites.
- `tests/regression/` — cross-phase contract tests (the regression corpus). Run by
  `scripts/regression.sh` (default mock; `--real` runs the real corpus).
- `.claude/kb-config.json` — shared KB path + remote (optional, written by setup.sh).
- `docs/.kb-snapshot.md` — KB INDEX loaded this session (auto-generated, gitignored).

## Capability matrix (which tools get what)

- **Claude Code — full (reference implementation).** Generated commands; all three
  lifecycle hooks WITH context injection (SessionStart / PreCompact / SubagentStop);
  named subagents (`.claude/agents/*.md`); `@AGENTS.md` import; shared KB.
- **Cursor — full (verified against cursor.com/docs, 2026-06).** Generated
  commands (`.cursor/commands/`); the three lifecycle hooks via `.cursor/hooks.json`
  (sessionStart / preCompact / subagentStop) wired to the SAME shared hook scripts —
  sessionStart injects context via a JSON-envelope wrapper
  (`cursor-session-start.sh`); named subagents work natively because Cursor reads
  `.claude/agents/*.md` directly (no duplication); methodology via a
  `.cursor/rules/` pointer at this file. Known degradations: `model: haiku/opus`
  tiers are Claude-specific (Cursor falls back to inherit/compatible), and Cursor's
  preCompact is observational (the snapshot side-effect still runs; no context
  modification).
- **Everything else.** Reads this `AGENTS.md` if it supports the open standard.
  No generated adapters. Not claimed as supported in v2.0.
