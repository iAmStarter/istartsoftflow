description: Run one phase end-to-end. TDD phases run SCAFFOLD -> RED -> GREEN; non-TDD phases run IMPLEMENT -> TEST. Both with the debug circuit breaker and the regression guard at CLOSE.
argument-hint: [phase number]
---

Caveman ULTRA mode. You are the ORCHESTRATOR. Route work to subagents —
you do NOT implement or debug yourself.

Note: subagents cannot talk to the user. Only YOU can.

Target phase: $ARGUMENTS  (default: the phase marked pending in docs/PLAN.md)

---

## 0. PRE-FLIGHT

a. INFRA CHECK (phases > 0):

b. PHASE STATE CHECK: Read docs/STATE.md and docs/PLAN.md.
   - No phase in progress, requested is next pending -> START at step 1.
   - Same phase in-progress -> RESUME from STATE.md "next action".
   - Different phase in-progress -> STOP. Tell me which phase is open.
   - Out of dependency order -> STOP. Warn, proceed only if I confirm.
   - Phase not in PLAN.md -> STOP. Suggest /overview or /replan.

c. FINAL PHASE CHECK: Read docs/PLAN.md. Is this the last phase (no further
   pending phases after this one)? Record this as IS_FINAL_PHASE=true/false.

## 1. RESEARCH + TDD APPLICABILITY

Dispatch `researcher` in IMPL mode scoped to this phase.
Returns terse summary + path. Read the file only if needed.
Unknowns block the phase -> re-dispatch narrowed. No guessing.

Then classify the phase:

  `TDD_PHASE` = the phase adds or changes a PUBLIC CALLABLE SURFACE (endpoint,
  exported function/class, CLI command, message contract) assertable from the
  acceptance spec. Size is NOT the criterion.

- Clear public surface -> `TDD_PHASE=true` -> run the TDD path (§2 → §3a → §3b).
- Pure infra/config/doc, no public surface -> `TDD_PHASE=false` -> run the
  non-TDD path (§2N → §3N).
- AMBIGUOUS -> default `TDD_PHASE=true`, but STATE the classification + the reason
  to me, so I can override to non-TDD BEFORE SCAFFOLD fires. (Hard rule 11: never
  downgrade a TDD phase just to dodge the RED gate.)

=====================================================================
## TDD PATH  (TDD_PHASE=true)
=====================================================================

## 2. SCAFFOLD

Dispatch `implementer` in SCAFFOLD mode: interface stubs only (signatures +
types; bodies raise NotImplementedError / return 501); NO logic, NO tests.
Returns the stub files + the interface surface.

## 3a. RED

Dispatch `test-author` to write the REAL API suite (+ mock) BLIND against the
stubs + acceptance. Place contract/ENDPOINTS tests in `tests/regression/`,
phase-local tests in `tests/phase-<n>/`. Run the suite.

RED GATE = every acceptance test COLLECTS cleanly AND FAILS (assertion /
NotImplemented).
- Any test PASSES on stubs -> STOP (spec trivial or test wrong); show me.
- Collection / import / syntax error -> stub mismatch; re-dispatch SCAFFOLD to
  fix SIGNATURES (not logic); re-run.
- UNDERSPEC -> STOP; ask me to sharpen the acceptance spec.

## 3b. GREEN

Dispatch `implementer` in FILL mode with the phase spec + research + the test
file paths (it MAY read the tests — frozen before logic, no overfit — but must
NOT edit them). Fill to green. Budget 3, WARN@2, STUCK@3.

`scripts/e2e-stack.sh up` / Playwright / `down`).

PHASE GATE (rule 5) -> go to §4/§5/§6 (see GATE below).

=====================================================================
## NON-TDD PATH  (TDD_PHASE=false)
=====================================================================

## 2N. IMPLEMENT

Dispatch `implementer` (legacy mode) with phase spec + research summary.
Returns STUCK -> go to ESCALATE.
If IS_FINAL_PHASE: phase spec includes the deploy task; confirm the return
includes "deployed URL" before proceeding.

## 3N. TEST (blind)

Dispatch `test-author`. It writes MOCK + REAL API suites from the acceptance
spec — never reads the logic. (e2e-runner only if frontend.)

=====================================================================

## GATE (both paths)

PHASE GATE = current-phase REAL API suite passes AND (if frontend) E2E passes AND
the accumulated mock regression corpus stays green AND every docs/ENDPOINTS.md
entry has a regression test (checked at CLOSE).
- GATE PASS -> go to CLOSE.
- GATE FAIL (LOGIC FAIL) -> go to FIX.

---

## 4. FIX

Dispatch `debugger` (isolated context) on the specific failure.
- FIXED -> re-run TEST (and the regression corpus).
- WARN (2 attempts failed) -> relay immediately, then let debugger finish attempt 3.
- STUCK -> go to ESCALATE.

---

## 5. ESCALATE — circuit breaker. Mode B.

FIRST STUCK: STOP. Present to me: the problem, 3 failed hypotheses, the
debugger's recommendation, the debug file path. Ask what to do. Wait. Options:
  (a) "re-research" -> /unstuck
  (b) hint -> re-dispatch debugger with hint, budget 3
  (c) "skip" / "re-slice" -> mark blocked, dispatch planner

SECOND STUCK: STOP completely. Full summary — every hypothesis, current state,
what to try next. Hand control to me.

---

## 6. CLOSE

REGRESSION GATE (before closing — Feature 3):
- Run `scripts/regression.sh` (mock corpus). A failure BLOCKS close -> route to FIX.
- ENDPOINTS COVERAGE: every `docs/ENDPOINTS.md` entry MUST have >=1 test in
  `tests/regression/`. Zero coverage -> FAIL HARD; do not close.
- IF IS_FINAL_PHASE: additionally run `scripts/regression.sh --real` (full real
  corpus). A failure blocks close.

Mark phase `done` in docs/PLAN.md.

ARCHITECTURE SELF-CHECK: did this phase add/remove/rename an agent, hook, or
command, or change a workflow rule? YES -> run `/log-decision`. NO -> state why not.

IF IS_FINAL_PHASE — FINAL CLOSE sequence:

  a. Run `/synthesize` — pass the signal that this is the final phase so the
     synthesizer runs the extended pass (OVERVIEW.md + README.md update).

  b. Read docs/ENDPOINTS.md. Surface a "READY TO USE" summary to me:
     ```
     ✅ PROJECT COMPLETE


     ## Endpoints
     <paste the full docs/ENDPOINTS.md table>

     ## Quick start
     - Base URL: <URL>
     - Auth: <Bearer token / API key / none — from ENDPOINTS.md>
     - Health check: GET <base URL>/health

     ## Docs
     - Full endpoint catalogue: docs/ENDPOINTS.md
     - Project history: docs/HISTORY.md
     ```
  Tell me the project is complete and ready to use.

ELSE (not final phase):

  Run `/synthesize`.
  Tell me phase done + the next phase. Recommend `/clear` then `/phase` next.

---

## STATE CHECKPOINTING

After each step, update docs/STATE.md:
```

phase: <n> (in progress)
tdd: <true|false>
completed: <steps done so far>
next: <exact next step>
blocker: <none or open issue>

```
Keep STATE.md small — overwrite, do not append.
